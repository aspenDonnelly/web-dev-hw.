# Version Control System
A version control system allows us to keep track of the changes we are making. This system also allows us to easily reverse the changes we have made. We are also able to have more than one person work on something with a Version Control System. We are using this one because it is very easy for people to comment and share ideas. Github is made to be used by multiple people to share data.

I had to do the linking steps over several times and follow the instructions each time but I am just beginning. I liked that when things worked exactly how they should I knew I had done them right and followed the steps correctly. This is all new information and it is pretty difficult sometimes. I do however think it all clicked. I did not have any disasters.
